## 📖 About This Project

This is my personal portfolio website, designed to be a digital playground where I showcase my coding journey, projects, and creative experiments. It is built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** feel using vanilla technologies, focusing on high performance, interactivity, and a premium user experience.

The site is designed to be "fun yet professional," featuring gamified elements like a theme switcher and an interactive playground.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **🎨 Dynamic Theme System**: A robust theme switcher with 6+ modes including Apple Light, Dark Mode, Retro Mode, and Seasonal themes (Christmas, Halloween, CNY).
-   **🍱 Bento Grid Layout**: A modern, responsive grid layout for the "About Me" section.
-   **🕹️ Interactive Playground**: A dedicated section for mini-games and tools:
    -   **Wordle**: A clone of the popular word game.
    -   **Sudoku**: Classic number puzzle.
    -   **Tic Tac Toe**: Play against an "Impossible" AI (Minimax algorithm).
-   **⏳ Animated Journey Timeline**: A scroll-triggered timeline visualization of my education and career milestones.
-   **⚡ Zero External Frameworks**: Built entirely with native HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for raw performance and learning.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox, Grid), JavaScript (ES6+).
-   **Deployment**: Vercel.
